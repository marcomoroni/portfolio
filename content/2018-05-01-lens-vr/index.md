This experimental VR application developed for [Disney Research](https://www.disneyresearch.com/) lets you navigate through a dataset. One of the controllers is a lens that distorts what you see and magnifies a certain area.

I worked in a team of six people, and I was responsible for:
* setting up and supervising version control on GitHub. For this, I also prepared cheat sheets for who was less familiar with Git and GitHub;
* the importation and visualization of the datasets in Unity;
* the user experience.

It was awarded as the second best group project of the year, but this doesn't mean everything went perfectly. For me, the biggest problem we had during the development was that we were not entirely sure what was the final use of it: I think it's important for people to be motivated to know were their project will be used and why is it important. In any case, a positive attitude sometimes it's all that's needed!
