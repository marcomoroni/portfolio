For the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) 2023 I made a tiny game with turnips.

The gameplay is very simple: tap or press ‘space’ at the right moment to harvest a vegetable.

The 3D models are made with [Spline](https://spline.design/), while the gradient materials, as well as the UI elements, are created procedurally via shaders.
