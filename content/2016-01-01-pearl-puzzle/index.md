The theme for the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) 2017 was *waves* and because it was my first Game Jam, I decided to keep it simple. I participated with a friend and we had a lot of fun!

Here's how you play it: by pressing the directional arrows you move all the movable pieces on the grid by 1 step in the direction you chose. Your goal is to place all the pearls back to the corresponding shell.

After the 48 hours we ended up with the two working levels that you can see below.
