This was the Honours Project for my degree in Games Development at Edinburgh Napier University. I studied and classified the different procedural content generation (PCG) techniques and used them to create cities similar to the ones drawn by [Minna O.](https://nokkasili.tumblr.com/):

{{ image(src="minna03.jpg", stretch=true) }}
{{ image(src="minna04.jpg", stretch=true) }}
{{ image(src="minna05.jpg", stretch=true) }}

The following are screenshots of the generated artefacts (made in Unity — they are 3D and interactive). I was extremely lucky to have Minna helping me throughout the project — she made all the assets I needed!

{{ image(src="perspective-03.png", stretch=true, full_width=true) }}

And a 2D one:

{{ image(src="ortho-01.png", stretch=true, full_width=true) }}

Needless to say, the final result is way more limited than initially imagined, but I'm extremely happy with what I've learnt. Procedural art is really fascinating!
